# Hi, we're EpicExecute :wave:

We're a few **passionate, talented developers** and **experienced business consultants** that believe in building **solutions-focused apps** to **get work done**.

## What We Do

We help businesses build beautiful and easy to use solutions (usually software, sometimes hardware) to get work done.

Our experienced business consultants understand the heart of our partners' businesses and work alongside talented developers to create turn-key solutions for them.

We have substantial work experience in bootstrapped and funded startups, so we know what it takes to come up with the right solution and get the job done!

## Our Philosophy

***Solutions > Software***

For a lot of businesses, the average SAAS ("Software-as-a-Service") product simply wasn’t built for you. It was built for anywhere from a small subset of users to a little bit of everyone. And somehow it seems like that "ideal user" is never *you*!

***We know because we've built those apps.***

SMBs struggle to make certain SAAS products work for them. Adopting commercially available software often means more work, customizations, and filling in the gaps. "Working around things" becomes a way of life that severely impacts workflow.

***So why don't more companies create their own solutions to their problems?***

Custom software is expensive (like Silicon Valley expensive). Implementation costs are high. On-going support is even higher.

For non-technical companies there’s many costs beyond hiring a developer to "just build it" — infrastructure, maintenance, new feature development, security, and compliance can quickly soar to mid-six-figure operating costs. And when you're competing with tech giants for talent, those costs just keep getting higher.

Lots of companies are stuck with SAAS that doesn't fulfill their needs, expensive in-house software teams that are slow and unfocused, or money-hungry agencies that don't "get" their business and don't stick around to support what they build.

***We don't think that's fair.***

And that's why we're here to help you execute, epically.
